    ## Description
    
    This is a team profile generator developed using node.js and javascript as its main languages

    - My motivation to start this project was to be able to understand a lot more about node, js and other node module featurs.
    - I built this project because it can make it a lot simpler for someone to create their team's profile when you just enter their info and the rest is done by the computer.
    - This solves the issue of having to create a full web app from scratch just to display your teams's profiles.
    - I learnt a lot more about inquirer, testing and inquirer-loop.
